# Jinjalume

Server-rendered Tailwind UI components for Flask, Jinja, and Python web apps.

Jinjalume is an open-source, HTML-first component kit for developers who want reusable UI in Jinja templates without adopting a frontend SPA framework.

> Early MVP: the API and visual language will evolve. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## What is included

- A small Flask extension that makes Jinjalume templates available to your app
- Reusable Jinja macros for buttons, badges, alerts, cards, inputs, textareas, avatars, spinners, and dialogs
- A copy-paste [component reference](docs/components.md) with signatures and rendered markup examples
- Tailwind CSS v4 build setup
- A working Flask demo
- Copy-paste UI blocks for authentication and admin dashboards
- Contributor documentation, issue templates, and continuous integration

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

npm install
npm run build:css
flask --app demo.app run --debug
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000>.

Browse the component gallery at <https://phcodesage.github.io/jinjalume/>.

## PyPI release

Releases are published from GitHub Actions when a version tag such as `v0.1.0` is pushed. The workflow builds and validates both the source distribution and wheel, then publishes them through PyPI Trusted Publishing.

Before the first release, the project maintainer must add a pending publisher at <https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/> with:

- PyPI project name: `jinjalume`
- GitHub owner: `phcodesage`
- GitHub repository: `jinjalume`
- Workflow name: `release.yml`
- GitHub environment: `pypi`

After that one-time setup, create a GitHub release or push a tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The first successful publish creates the PyPI project at <https://pypi.org/project/jinjalume/>.

## Use in a Flask app

```python
from flask import Flask

from jinjalume import Jinjalume

app = Flask(__name__)
Jinjalume(app)
```

Then import a component in a Jinja template:

```jinja
{% from "jinjalume/components/button.html" import button %}

{{ button("Save changes", variant="primary", type="submit") }}
```

The extension only registers Jinjalume's templates. Your application remains responsible for building and serving its Tailwind CSS file.

## Available components

Import the macros you need from `jinjalume/components/`:

- `button.html` — primary, secondary, and danger actions
- `badge.html` — compact status labels
- `alert.html` — informational, success, warning, and danger messages
- `card.html` — content containers with a caller block
- `input.html` and `textarea.html` — labeled fields with help and error states
- `select.html` — native select fields with selected options and help/error states
- `avatar.html` — image or initials avatar
- `spinner.html` — accessible loading indicator
- `modal.html` — native HTML dialog markup for progressive enhancement

All components are plain Jinja macros. They do not require a JavaScript framework, and interactive behavior can be progressively enhanced with native browser APIs, HTMX, or Alpine.js.

See [docs/components.md](docs/components.md) for copy-paste examples and the full argument reference. The demo gallery renders every component at <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> after the development server starts.

## Themes and optional HTMX example

The demo includes a light/dark toggle backed by semantic CSS custom properties. Light mode is the default; applications opt in by setting `data-theme="dark"` on the document root. Read the [theming proposal](docs/theming.md) for the token contract and Tailwind integration notes.

The `/htmx` demo shows an optional HTMX enhancement around a normal Flask form. The form remains usable without JavaScript or HTMX, and HTMX is loaded only by that demo page. The core package has no HTMX dependency.

## UI blocks

The demo also includes realistic application screens at `/blocks`, `/login`, `/signup`, and `/admin`. The reusable block macros live under `jinjalume/blocks/` and compose the core components into auth flows and a responsive admin console. See [docs/blocks.md](docs/blocks.md) for signatures and copy-paste examples.

The public landing page source lives in [`site/`](site/). The Pages workflow publishes it from the `main` branch. Before the first deployment, a repository administrator or maintainer must open [Settings → Pages](https://github.com/phcodesage/jinjalume/settings/pages) and select **GitHub Actions** as the build source; this is a one-time repository setting that cannot be enabled by the default workflow token.

## Development

```bash
make install
make test
make lint
make css
```

Run the CSS watcher and Flask in separate terminals while developing:

```bash
npm run dev:css
flask --app demo.app run --debug
```

## Roadmap

- WTForms helpers and validation states
- More accessible interactive components using progressive enhancement
- Optional Alpine.js integrations
- RTL examples and expanded theme customization
